                            for relevant queries.”
                            Designing and updating your site for SEO is simple when you know what improves your rating
                            in a search result and what makes it fall. Utilize the checklist to incorporate SEO into
                            your digital marketing strategy after learning more about SEO in the section below. SEO
                            checklist: How to improve your results
                            The good news about SEO planning is that what works for SEO also aligns with providing a
                            positive user experience (UX) for people who visit your website. So, SEO-friendly changes
                            equal a better site for the people you want to engage.
                            “SEO should be a consideration throughout every step of your website build and your
                            marketing journey,” says Ade Lewis, Partnerships Director at Mailchimp. “It’s the number one
                            way a consumer will find a small business.”
                            Review this checklist to learn about the changes and adjustments you can make to improve
                            your SEO.
                            Feature relevant keywords. Keywords are words or phrases that people type into search
                            engines to find something. All areas of your website—including page names, headlines, site
                            copy, image captions, page descriptions, and URLs—need to include keywords in a natural way
                            that doesn’t sound too forced.
                            Since people search with specific needs in mind, your keywords should be “long tail,”
                            meaning descriptive and narrowly focused. For example, “wedding photography Newport RI” will
                            work better than just “professional photography.” Specific keywords will bring in less
                            traffic overall, but ranking for more detailed searches will result in a higher conversion
                            rate.
                            Have a clean site structure. Make sure your website is organized in a way that makes it easy
                            for users and search engines to travel through your site and find what they’re looking for.
                            Internal links from one page to another within your site should provide content that
                            educates your visitor, answers a question about what you offer, or engages them in some
                            other valuable way. Internal links give Google more clues about what your website is about,
                            so it can send relevant visitors your way.
                            Feature substantial content. Create website content that’s relevant to your top keywords and
                            hefty enough to be valuable. While punchy, skimmable content is great, keep in mind that
                            Google wants content that solves the search intent, so pages with fewer than 200 words will
                            not be highly ranked. If you want to add meat to your copy, be sure each page solves a
                            problem, answers a question, or moves a visitor forward in their journey through your site.
                            Use relevant title tags. A title tag or page tag is the “headline” for a page when it
                            appears in search engine results pages (SERP). The words or phrases in your title tags
                            should be specific and descriptive. Think, “Learn How to Paint Landscapes and Portraits"
                            instead of "Painting Class." Combining this with the meta description—a longer blurb in
                            search results that says more about what your content provides—encourages users to click
                            through to your website. Title tags also appear in your visitors’ web browser tabs and in
                            social media when your content is shared. This is easy to do in Mailchimp’s website builder.
                            Simply go to the page settings and edit the SEO title to create a title tag and the SEO
                            description to write a meta description.
                            Add alt tags. An alt tag is a text description of an image. It serves 3 important purposes.
                            Search engines can’t interpret images, so alt tags help them identify and rank these pieces
                            of content, improving your SEO. They also help website visitors when an image doesn’t
                            display properly on their screen or load quickly by providing a clue about what image they
                            should be seeing. Last, and definitely not least, alt tags are easy for screen readers to
                            decipher, so they help with web accessibility. Alt tags should be short and
                            descriptive—think, “paddle board on lake with smiling boy” or “chocolate cake with vanilla
                            frosting and strawberry.”
                            Optimize for mobile. Google prioritizes mobile websites, so making sure your website is
                            mobile friendly is critical. This means providing a visually pleasing and easy-to-use
                            experience no matter what device someone is visiting from. Mobile sites also must load
                            quickly on a 3G connection, render properly on any sized screen, have well-spaced site
                            elements that users can easily tap on to take action, and feature content that’s entirely
                            visible without having to scroll left or right. Mailchimp websites are built with mobile in
                            mind—the website builder allows you to preview your website on a mobile phone to see how it
                            looks.
                            Enable fast load times. Ideally your pages should load in under 2 seconds—less than 3 is a
                            must. If they do, it’ll improve your search rankings. There are several things that can slow
                            down your load time, including issues with your content management system (CMS), poorly
                            written code, low bandwidth that can’t handle your traffic volume, or numerous large images
                            on a page. Use Google PageSpeed Insights to test how quickly your website is loading. Be
                            sure you host your website on a platform that enables fast load times.
                            Install Google Search Console and Analytics. Google Search Console will help you see if
                            Google is finding and indexing all of the pages on your website to highlight places you can
                            improve performance. It can also help you set up your own site search tracking. You can
                            connect to Google Analytics from your Mailchimp dashboard to monitor your traffic, see what
                            pages are being visited the most, and what links direct visitors to your website. Here's a
                            guide to help you set up Google Analytics.
                            Make sure your website and URL are secure. Google considers HTTPS encryption a top priority,
                            and will show a security warning in search results if a website is not HTTPs encrypted. Work
                            with a website builder that makes security a priority. All websites created with Mailchimp
                            include an SSL certificate—this encrypts data and guarantees the authenticity of a website
                            to visitors.

                            total control over the success of your company.
                            Anyone who hits your homepage needs to be immediately engaged if you want them to stay. When
                            you consider that 47% of visitors "bounce off" or quit a website after reading just one
                            page, the significance of this initial connection becomes even more obvious.

                            Being a good host at a party is similar to creating an effective webpage. Your site should
                            greet visitors, offer a space that's simple to explore, and assist them in finding what they
                            need.

                            According to Jen Ellis, Senior Product Design Manager at Mailchimp, "a homepage is a chance
                            to clearly out what you do and grab a visitor's attention." We are aware that visitors
                            decide quickly whether they want to learn more.
                            Communicate your top messages
                            The most important thing your homepage should do is clearly convey what you offer, and to
                            whom. If you can do this, you stand a good chance of engaging your visitor. Assess your
                            homepage by asking the following 2 questions.
                            1. Can anyone quickly “get” what you do? The layout, copy, and graphics on your homepage
                            should all work toward the goal of spelling out what your business offers. You’ll know
                            you’ve done it when a first-time visitor, in just a few moments, can understand what you do
                            or sell.
                            What’s typically required to achieve this clear homepage messaging is iteration. This just
                            means creating a homepage, showing it to people—including friends and potential target
                            audience members—and adjusting until it’s clear. Encourage people to be honest with you,
                            make adjustments, and show it to them again until you get it right.
                            2. Does your audience know they’re in the right place? Part of what makes a homepage
                            compelling to your audience is presenting information that’s valuable to them. Evoke this
                            feeling by using keywords they use to describe themselves in the context of your offering.
                            This is an easy but essential part of search engine optimization (SEO), and it not only
                            makes your website more discoverable on search, it makes your site more engaging. For
                            example, if you provide a service for people looking to meet someone, you might use terms
                            like “discerning" or “good match" if those are the aspirational words people use during this
                            process.
                            If you serve more than one audience, that’s ok. Just be sure to communicate to each one
                            separately. For example, if you broker paintings for artists, you may want to welcome both
                            gallery owners and individual buyers with separate sections that quickly communicate that
                            you’re an important contact for both.

                            set it up. When establishing and administering an IVA, all insolvency practitioners must
                            adhere to a set of guidelines.

                            <br />Most insolvency practitioners and creditors have signed up to a voluntary code of
                            practice known as the IVA Protocol.
                            <br />
                            The protocol's goal is to ensure that the processes involved in an individual voluntary
                            arrangement (IVA) are transparent and equitable. For all simple consumer IVAs, the protocol
                            establishes a uniform format.
                            <br />
                            The protocol establishes an uniform procedure for:<br />
                            the proposal's substance, how income and spending are calculated, how equity in the home is
                            handled, and the IVA's terms and conditions
                            If you have a regular income and at least three debts with two or more creditors, you will
                            be eligible for an IVA under the protocol.

                  arrangement between you and your creditors to repay your obligations over time. An insolvency
                  practitioner must put up an IVA. An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a debt solution that
                  allows you to pay off your unmanageable debts over time through a series of monthly instalments.
                  However, you must first determine if you qualify for an IVA and whether you can afford to continue
                  making payments.
                  The Creditfix expert's IVA calculator can assist you with this. First, it will assess your total
                  unsecured debts to determine if an IVA is the best debt solution for you, or if the size of your debt
                  means you should look into other insolvency options.

                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">An IVA is a type of insolvency that can be set up and managed by an IP and provides an alternative to bankruptcy by allowing you to write off up to 81% of your unsecured debt in accordance with government regulations. 
                    After you join an IVA, your creditors will be unable to contact you or take any further action against you. Your credit score will be impacted by an IVA for six years, and throughout the period of the plan, your details will be listed on the public Register of Insolvencies. However, you will be able to pay off your obligations. 
                    A single monthly payment is taken into account along with your present financial condition in an IVA, and this payment is then split up among the creditors you owe money to.An IVA may be tailored to your specific requirements, but it can be costly, and there are dangers to consider. An IVA can be used to pay off most debts, but there are certain exceptions.
                    All debt-related interest and fees are fixed for the term of your plan. The remaining debts are eliminated after the conclusion of the IVA, allowing you to start living debt-free. IVAs are legally binding contracts, so once your creditors have accepted their terms, they can no longer sue you in court or even get in touch with you. All communications will be sent through your debt management organisation or insolvency practitioner (IP).Any remaining debt will be forgiven after making regular payments toward your obligations for the predetermined amount of time, usually five or six years, as agreed upon with your creditors. That implies that you will no longer be in charge of it, allowing you to continue living your financial life.

                  <h5 class="entry-heading">Mortgages, secured loans, and rent are all options</h5>
                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">Secured loans are loans that are backed by your house. This implies that if you
                    can't pay your loan, they can seize your home. Secured loans, mortgages, and rent arrears can all be
                    included in an IVA. Your creditor, on the other hand, will have to agree to it being included, which
                    they are unlikely to do. </p>
                  <h5 class="entry-heading">The maximum amount of debt that can be included in the calculation </h5>
                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">
                    In an IVA, any amount of debt can be included. The law does not impose any minimum or maximum
                    restrictions. Because IVA fees are so costly, an IVA may not be the best option if your total debt
                    is less than £10,000.
                    <br />
                    Any number of debts can be included, but if you have more than one creditor, an IVA is usually the
                    best option.
                    <br />
                    IVAs are adaptable. If you feel an IVA is best for you, your insolvency practitioner will tell you
                    if your debts are appropriate for one.
                    <br />
                    Debts that you are unable to include
                    <br />
                    Debts you can’t include in an IVA are:
                    <br />
                    child support arrears that have been ordered by a court <br />
                    penalties imposed by courts on student loans <br />
                    Loans from the Social Fund <br />
                    Arrears on television licences<br />
                    What should you do about debts that you are unable to include? <br />
                    <br />
                    If you have debts that aren't eligible for an IVA, you'll have to deal with them individually, so
                    make sure you have the money to pay them before putting money into an IVA.

                    <br />at an individual voluntary arrangement is
                    <br />A formal and legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to repay your debts over
                    a period of time is known as an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). This implies the court has
                    authorised it, and your creditors must follow it.
                    <br />
                    An IVA may be tailored to your specific requirements, but it can be costly, and there are dangers to
                    consider.

                        the insolvency practitioner. These are frequently high and are calculated depending on the
                        amount you repay through the IVA.

                      <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">If you want to file for an IVA, you and the insolvency practitioner will
                        come up with a repayment plan. This might be in the form of monthly instalments, a lump sum
                        payment, or a combination of the two.
                        <br />
                        The repayment plan should be based on an amount you can afford, and it must be agreed upon by
                        your creditors. If you pay on a regular basis, the IVA normally lasts 5 to 6 years.
                        <br />
                        Repayments will be made to the insolvency practitioner directly. The money will subsequently be
                        distributed to your creditors. The insolvency practitioner will keep some of this to pay their
                        fees.
                        <br />
                        You won't be able to pay off your obligations in full by the conclusion of your IVA if your
                        payments aren't sufficient.

                        lawyer or accountant, known as an insolvency practitioner, may put up an IVA (IP). Their prices
                        can be rather substantial, and they vary based on the type of job they do. There are no
                        professional or legal rules for how much IPs should charge, although prices are often in the
                        £5,000 range.

                        deducted to cover the costs. When you pay your monthly IVA payment, a portion of the money goes
                        to the insolvency practitioner, and the remainder goes to the creditors.

                        During the IVA, the IP serves three purposes. For each of these positions, they will charge you.
                        The following are examples of these:
                        <br />
                        nominee: the IP will assist you to put together an IVA proposal, filing an application with the
                        court, and holding a meeting with your creditors to seek agreement on the proposal. adviser: the
                        IP will advise you on whether an IVA is a good idea. An insolvency practitioner must perform
                        this task by law. When the court authorises the IVA and the creditors agree, the IP will oversee
                        the IVA as it advances, ensuring that the creditors get the monthly payments and serving as a
                        go-between for you and the creditors., as well as the creditors, if something goes wrong.

                        <br />
                        If you decide to set up an IVA, you should get quotations from several insolvency practitioners
                        to see what costs they would charge you. You'll be able to compare prices this way.

                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px"> You may be eligible to acquire an IVA to avoid bankruptcy if a creditor is

                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">
                    It's critical to understand the dangers of an IVA. An IVA may not be appropriate if your
                    circumstances are anticipated to change in the near future. If you are unable to make your payments,
                    the IVA may be terminated. Your creditors will be entitled to take legal action against you if the
                    IVA fails. They have the potential to bankrupt you.

                    An IVA may be rejected by your creditors. You'll have to discover another debt solution if this
                    happens.

                    If you start an IVA and it doesn't work out, you can file for bankruptcy.

                  <h5 class="entry-heading">Impact of a single voluntary arrangement at home</h5>


                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px"> An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a formal, legally enforceable
                    arrangement between you and your creditors to repay your obligations over time. An insolvency
                    practitioner must put up an IVA.

                    An IVA may be tailored to your specific requirements, but it can be costly, and there are dangers to
                    consider.

                    This article explains how an IVA could affect your house.

                    Refinancing your house

                    If you own your house, the value of it will be factored into your IVA. This implies that in the last
                    year of your IVA, you'll have to have a house value to see how much equity you have. After any
                    mortgages are paid off, equity is the amount of money you'd make if you sold your home.

                    If the appraisal reveals that the property has more than £5,000 in equity, you will most likely need
                    to re-mortgage to generate a lump payment to put into the IVA. However, you should not have to sell
                    your property in order to do so.
                    Most IVAs include a cap on how much you may remortgage to pay down your debt. The maximum is
                    determined by the value of your property and the amount of your existing mortgage. If the new
                    mortgage term exceeds the previous mortgage term or your state retirement age, you will not be
                    compelled to remortgage.

                    If you are unable to re-mortgage, you will be required to pay the IVA's regular monthly instalments
                    for another twelve months.
                  </p>

                  <h5 class="entry-heading">Is it possible to keep your house out of an IVA?</h5>

                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">You might be able to keep your house out of the IVA in severe situations. Your
                    creditors, on the other hand, may be unwilling to consent to this. An insolvency professional will
                    be able to help you with your specific circumstances. If you're unsure, seek guidance.

                    Assets or future income

                    An IVA may have an impact on any future income or assets you receive. If you decide to sell your
                    home while you have an IVA, all proceeds from the sale may be required to be paid into the IVA.

                    You must notify your insolvency practitioner if your income rises while you are under an IVA. You
                    might be breaking the law if you don't.
                    A windfall provision is frequently included in an IVA when it is created. A windfall is money
                    received unexpectedly, such as through a lottery win, an inheritance, or a bonus payment. You must
                    pay any windfall money into your IVA if your IVA contains a windfall provision.
                  </p>

                  <h5 class="entry-heading"> The implications of an individual voluntary agreement on bank accounts,savings, and pensions
                    Accounts in a bank</h5>

                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">If you are granted an IVA, you may be required to change your bank account while
                    the IVA is being processed. This is because your bank may be able to deduct funds from your account
                    to settle any outstanding bills. This is referred to as the 'right to offset.' Only if your bank
                    account is linked to the firm to whom you owe the debt may a bank do this.

                    If your bank account is related to your debts, you should change banks. Your income will be secure
                    in this manner.

                    You won't need to update your bank account if it isn't linked to your debts.
                    Your insolvency practitioner will be able to help you if you decide to acquire an IVA.</p>


                  <h5 class="entry-heading">Selecting a volunteer arrangement provider on an individual basis

                    What's best for you will be determined by the following factors:

                    practitioner to represent you in making an IVA proposal to your creditors. Typically, insolvency
                    practitioners are licensed lawyers or accountants.

                      <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">The next step is to identify someone to assist you in setting up the arrangement if you feel an IVA is the best option for you. Only an Insolvency Practitioner (IP), a certified debt management specialist whose duty it is to set up and manage the IVA for you, is authorised to create an IVA. 
                        You shouldn't have to look for an IP on your own because the majority of debt relief organisations work with internal IPs.

                      <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">The next step is for you to collaborate with your insolvency practitioner to prepare an IVA proposal, also known as an IVA agreement. 
                            Each month, they'll take a look at both your income and your necessary spending to determine the amount you should contribute each month.

                      <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">Your insolvency practitioner will inform your creditors when your IVA proposal is complete.
                         You will engage into a legally-binding agreement to deal with your debts if your IVA is authorised and the majority of your creditors accept the proposal's provisions.

                      <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px;">Making your monthly payments is the only thing left to do after your IVA has been authorised. Your IVA payment term will typically be five or six years, and they will be automatically deducted each month at the same time from the bank account you've chosen. Your leftover debt will be forgiven at the conclusion of your term.</p>

                              and your creditors to pay back your debts over a period of time. An insolvency
                              practitioner must set it up. When establishing and administering an IVA, all insolvency
                              practitioners must adhere to a set of guidelines.

                              <br />Most insolvency practitioners and creditors have signed up to a voluntary code of
                              practice known as the IVA Protocol.
                              <br />
                              The protocol's goal is to ensure that the processes involved in an individual voluntary
                              arrangement (IVA) are transparent and equitable. For all simple consumer IVAs, the
                              protocol establishes a uniform format.
                              <br />
                              The protocol establishes an uniform procedure for:<br />
                              the proposal's substance, how income and spending are calculated, how equity in the home
                              is handled, and the IVA's terms and conditions
                              If you have a regular income and at least three debts with two or more creditors, you will
                              be eligible for an IVA under the protocol.
