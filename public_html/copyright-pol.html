                            business." "You'll draw in the right audience if you take steps to ensure you rank highly
                            for relevant queries.”
                            Designing and updating your site for SEO is simple when you know what improves your rating
                            in a search result and what makes it fall. Utilize the checklist to incorporate SEO into
                            your digital marketing strategy after learning more about SEO in the section below. SEO
                            checklist: How to improve your results
                            The good news about SEO planning is that what works for SEO also aligns with providing a
                            positive user experience (UX) for people who visit your website. So, SEO-friendly changes
                            equal a better site for the people you want to engage.
                            “SEO should be a consideration throughout every step of your website build and your
                            marketing journey,” says Ade Lewis, Partnerships Director at Mailchimp. “It’s the number one
                            way a consumer will find a small business.”
                            Review this checklist to learn about the changes and adjustments you can make to improve
                            your SEO.
                            Feature relevant keywords. Keywords are words or phrases that people type into search
                            engines to find something. All areas of your website—including page names, headlines, site
                            copy, image captions, page descriptions, and URLs—need to include keywords in a natural way
                            that doesn’t sound too forced.
                            Since people search with specific needs in mind, your keywords should be “long tail,”
                            meaning descriptive and narrowly focused. For example, “wedding photography Newport RI” will
                            work better than just “professional photography.” Specific keywords will bring in less
                            traffic overall, but ranking for more detailed searches will result in a higher conversion
                            rate.
                            Have a clean site structure. Make sure your website is organized in a way that makes it easy
                            for users and search engines to travel through your site and find what they’re looking for.
                            Internal links from one page to another within your site should provide content that
                            educates your visitor, answers a question about what you offer, or engages them in some
                            other valuable way. Internal links give Google more clues about what your website is about,
                            so it can send relevant visitors your way.
                            Feature substantial content. Create website content that’s relevant to your top keywords and
                            hefty enough to be valuable. While punchy, skimmable content is great, keep in mind that
                            Google wants content that solves the search intent, so pages with fewer than 200 words will
                            not be highly ranked. If you want to add meat to your copy, be sure each page solves a
                            problem, answers a question, or moves a visitor forward in their journey through your site.
                            Use relevant title tags. A title tag or page tag is the “headline” for a page when it
                            appears in search engine results pages (SERP). The words or phrases in your title tags
                            should be specific and descriptive. Think, “Learn How to Paint Landscapes and Portraits"
                            instead of "Painting Class." Combining this with the meta description—a longer blurb in
                            search results that says more about what your content provides—encourages users to click
                            through to your website. Title tags also appear in your visitors’ web browser tabs and in
                            social media when your content is shared. This is easy to do in Mailchimp’s website builder.
                            Simply go to the page settings and edit the SEO title to create a title tag and the SEO
                            description to write a meta description.
                            Add alt tags. An alt tag is a text description of an image. It serves 3 important purposes.
                            Search engines can’t interpret images, so alt tags help them identify and rank these pieces
                            of content, improving your SEO. They also help website visitors when an image doesn’t
                            display properly on their screen or load quickly by providing a clue about what image they
                            should be seeing. Last, and definitely not least, alt tags are easy for screen readers to
                            decipher, so they help with web accessibility. Alt tags should be short and
                            descriptive—think, “paddle board on lake with smiling boy” or “chocolate cake with vanilla
                            frosting and strawberry.”
                            Optimize for mobile. Google prioritizes mobile websites, so making sure your website is
                            mobile friendly is critical. This means providing a visually pleasing and easy-to-use
                            experience no matter what device someone is visiting from. Mobile sites also must load
                            quickly on a 3G connection, render properly on any sized screen, have well-spaced site
                            elements that users can easily tap on to take action, and feature content that’s entirely
                            visible without having to scroll left or right. Mailchimp websites are built with mobile in
                            mind—the website builder allows you to preview your website on a mobile phone to see how it
                            looks.
                            Enable fast load times. Ideally your pages should load in under 2 seconds—less than 3 is a
                            must. If they do, it’ll improve your search rankings. There are several things that can slow
                            down your load time, including issues with your content management system (CMS), poorly
                            written code, low bandwidth that can’t handle your traffic volume, or numerous large images
                            on a page. Use Google PageSpeed Insights to test how quickly your website is loading. Be
                            sure you host your website on a platform that enables fast load times.
                            Install Google Search Console and Analytics. Google Search Console will help you see if
                            Google is finding and indexing all of the pages on your website to highlight places you can
                            improve performance. It can also help you set up your own site search tracking. You can
                            connect to Google Analytics from your Mailchimp dashboard to monitor your traffic, see what
                            pages are being visited the most, and what links direct visitors to your website. Here's a
                            guide to help you set up Google Analytics.
                            Make sure your website and URL are secure. Google considers HTTPS encryption a top priority,
                            and will show a security warning in search results if a website is not HTTPs encrypted. Work
                            with a website builder that makes security a priority. All websites created with Mailchimp
                            include an SSL certificate—this encrypts data and guarantees the authenticity of a website
                            to visitors.

                            can now accept payments for tangible goods or schedule appointments directly from your

                            total control over the success of your company.
                            Anyone who hits your homepage needs to be immediately engaged if you want them to stay. When
                            you consider that 47% of visitors "bounce off" or quit a website after reading just one
                            page, the significance of this initial connection becomes even more obvious.

                            Being a good host at a party is similar to creating an effective webpage. Your site should
                            greet visitors, offer a space that's simple to explore, and assist them in finding what they
                            need.

                            According to Jen Ellis, Senior Product Design Manager at Mailchimp, "a homepage is a chance
                            to clearly out what you do and grab a visitor's attention." We are aware that visitors
                            decide quickly whether they want to learn more.
                            Communicate your top messages
                            The most important thing your homepage should do is clearly convey what you offer, and to
                            whom. If you can do this, you stand a good chance of engaging your visitor. Assess your
                            homepage by asking the following 2 questions.
                            1. Can anyone quickly “get” what you do? The layout, copy, and graphics on your homepage
                            should all work toward the goal of spelling out what your business offers. You’ll know
                            you’ve done it when a first-time visitor, in just a few moments, can understand what you do
                            or sell.
                            What’s typically required to achieve this clear homepage messaging is iteration. This just
                            means creating a homepage, showing it to people—including friends and potential target
                            audience members—and adjusting until it’s clear. Encourage people to be honest with you,
                            make adjustments, and show it to them again until you get it right.
                            2. Does your audience know they’re in the right place? Part of what makes a homepage
                            compelling to your audience is presenting information that’s valuable to them. Evoke this
                            feeling by using keywords they use to describe themselves in the context of your offering.
                            This is an easy but essential part of search engine optimization (SEO), and it not only
                            makes your website more discoverable on search, it makes your site more engaging. For
                            example, if you provide a service for people looking to meet someone, you might use terms
                            like “discerning" or “good match" if those are the aspirational words people use during this
                            process.
                            If you serve more than one audience, that’s ok. Just be sure to communicate to each one
                            separately. For example, if you broker paintings for artists, you may want to welcome both
                            gallery owners and individual buyers with separate sections that quickly communicate that
                            you’re an important contact for both.

                            set it up. When establishing and administering an IVA, all insolvency practitioners must
                            adhere to a set of guidelines.

                            <br />Most insolvency practitioners and creditors have signed up to a voluntary code of
                            practice known as the IVA Protocol.
                            <br />
                            The protocol's goal is to ensure that the processes involved in an individual voluntary
                            arrangement (IVA) are transparent and equitable. For all simple consumer IVAs, the protocol
                            establishes a uniform format.
                            <br />
                            The protocol establishes an uniform procedure for:<br />
                            the proposal's substance, how income and spending are calculated, how equity in the home is
                            handled, and the IVA's terms and conditions
                            If you have a regular income and at least three debts with two or more creditors, you will
                            be eligible for an IVA under the protocol.
