                            business." "You'll draw in the right audience if you take steps to ensure you rank highly
                            for relevant queries.”
                            Designing and updating your site for SEO is simple when you know what improves your rating
                            in a search result and what makes it fall. Utilize the checklist to incorporate SEO into
                            your digital marketing strategy after learning more about SEO in the section below. SEO
                            checklist: How to improve your results
                            The good news about SEO planning is that what works for SEO also aligns with providing a
                            positive user experience (UX) for people who visit your website. So, SEO-friendly changes
                            equal a better site for the people you want to engage.
                            “SEO should be a consideration throughout every step of your website build and your
                            marketing journey,” says Ade Lewis, Partnerships Director at Mailchimp. “It’s the number one
                            way a consumer will find a small business.”
                            Review this checklist to learn about the changes and adjustments you can make to improve
                            your SEO.
                            Feature relevant keywords. Keywords are words or phrases that people type into search
                            engines to find something. All areas of your website—including page names, headlines, site
                            copy, image captions, page descriptions, and URLs—need to include keywords in a natural way
                            that doesn’t sound too forced.
                            Since people search with specific needs in mind, your keywords should be “long tail,”
                            meaning descriptive and narrowly focused. For example, “wedding photography Newport RI” will
                            work better than just “professional photography.” Specific keywords will bring in less
                            traffic overall, but ranking for more detailed searches will result in a higher conversion
                            rate.
                            Have a clean site structure. Make sure your website is organized in a way that makes it easy
                            for users and search engines to travel through your site and find what they’re looking for.
                            Internal links from one page to another within your site should provide content that
                            educates your visitor, answers a question about what you offer, or engages them in some
                            other valuable way. Internal links give Google more clues about what your website is about,
                            so it can send relevant visitors your way.
                            Feature substantial content. Create website content that’s relevant to your top keywords and
                            hefty enough to be valuable. While punchy, skimmable content is great, keep in mind that
                            Google wants content that solves the search intent, so pages with fewer than 200 words will
                            not be highly ranked. If you want to add meat to your copy, be sure each page solves a
                            problem, answers a question, or moves a visitor forward in their journey through your site.
                            Use relevant title tags. A title tag or page tag is the “headline” for a page when it
                            appears in search engine results pages (SERP). The words or phrases in your title tags
                            should be specific and descriptive. Think, “Learn How to Paint Landscapes and Portraits"
                            instead of "Painting Class." Combining this with the meta description—a longer blurb in
                            search results that says more about what your content provides—encourages users to click
                            through to your website. Title tags also appear in your visitors’ web browser tabs and in
                            social media when your content is shared. This is easy to do in Mailchimp’s website builder.
                            Simply go to the page settings and edit the SEO title to create a title tag and the SEO
                            description to write a meta description.
                            Add alt tags. An alt tag is a text description of an image. It serves 3 important purposes.
                            Search engines can’t interpret images, so alt tags help them identify and rank these pieces
                            of content, improving your SEO. They also help website visitors when an image doesn’t
                            display properly on their screen or load quickly by providing a clue about what image they
                            should be seeing. Last, and definitely not least, alt tags are easy for screen readers to
                            decipher, so they help with web accessibility. Alt tags should be short and
                            descriptive—think, “paddle board on lake with smiling boy” or “chocolate cake with vanilla
                            frosting and strawberry.”
                            Optimize for mobile. Google prioritizes mobile websites, so making sure your website is
                            mobile friendly is critical. This means providing a visually pleasing and easy-to-use
                            experience no matter what device someone is visiting from. Mobile sites also must load
                            quickly on a 3G connection, render properly on any sized screen, have well-spaced site
                            elements that users can easily tap on to take action, and feature content that’s entirely
                            visible without having to scroll left or right. Mailchimp websites are built with mobile in
                            mind—the website builder allows you to preview your website on a mobile phone to see how it
                            looks.
                            Enable fast load times. Ideally your pages should load in under 2 seconds—less than 3 is a
                            must. If they do, it’ll improve your search rankings. There are several things that can slow
                            down your load time, including issues with your content management system (CMS), poorly
                            written code, low bandwidth that can’t handle your traffic volume, or numerous large images
                            on a page. Use Google PageSpeed Insights to test how quickly your website is loading. Be
                            sure you host your website on a platform that enables fast load times.
                            Install Google Search Console and Analytics. Google Search Console will help you see if
                            Google is finding and indexing all of the pages on your website to highlight places you can
                            improve performance. It can also help you set up your own site search tracking. You can
                            connect to Google Analytics from your Mailchimp dashboard to monitor your traffic, see what
                            pages are being visited the most, and what links direct visitors to your website. Here's a
                            guide to help you set up Google Analytics.
                            Make sure your website and URL are secure. Google considers HTTPS encryption a top priority,
                            and will show a security warning in search results if a website is not HTTPs encrypted. Work
                            with a website builder that makes security a priority. All websites created with Mailchimp
                            include an SSL certificate—this encrypts data and guarantees the authenticity of a website
                            to visitors.

                            can now accept payments for tangible goods or schedule appointments directly from your

                            total control over the success of your company.
                            Anyone who hits your homepage needs to be immediately engaged if you want them to stay. When
                            you consider that 47% of visitors "bounce off" or quit a website after reading just one
                            page, the significance of this initial connection becomes even more obvious.

                            Being a good host at a party is similar to creating an effective webpage. Your site should
                            greet visitors, offer a space that's simple to explore, and assist them in finding what they
                            need.

                            According to Jen Ellis, Senior Product Design Manager at Mailchimp, "a homepage is a chance
                            to clearly out what you do and grab a visitor's attention." We are aware that visitors
                            decide quickly whether they want to learn more.
                            Communicate your top messages
                            The most important thing your homepage should do is clearly convey what you offer, and to
                            whom. If you can do this, you stand a good chance of engaging your visitor. Assess your
                            homepage by asking the following 2 questions.
                            1. Can anyone quickly “get” what you do? The layout, copy, and graphics on your homepage
                            should all work toward the goal of spelling out what your business offers. You’ll know
                            you’ve done it when a first-time visitor, in just a few moments, can understand what you do
                            or sell.
                            What’s typically required to achieve this clear homepage messaging is iteration. This just
                            means creating a homepage, showing it to people—including friends and potential target
                            audience members—and adjusting until it’s clear. Encourage people to be honest with you,
                            make adjustments, and show it to them again until you get it right.
                            2. Does your audience know they’re in the right place? Part of what makes a homepage
                            compelling to your audience is presenting information that’s valuable to them. Evoke this
                            feeling by using keywords they use to describe themselves in the context of your offering.
                            This is an easy but essential part of search engine optimization (SEO), and it not only
                            makes your website more discoverable on search, it makes your site more engaging. For
                            example, if you provide a service for people looking to meet someone, you might use terms
                            like “discerning" or “good match" if those are the aspirational words people use during this
                            process.
                            If you serve more than one audience, that’s ok. Just be sure to communicate to each one
                            separately. For example, if you broker paintings for artists, you may want to welcome both
                            gallery owners and individual buyers with separate sections that quickly communicate that
                            you’re an important contact for both.

                            set it up. When establishing and administering an IVA, all insolvency practitioners must
                            adhere to a set of guidelines.

                            <br />Most insolvency practitioners and creditors have signed up to a voluntary code of
                            practice known as the IVA Protocol.
                            <br />
                            The protocol's goal is to ensure that the processes involved in an individual voluntary
                            arrangement (IVA) are transparent and equitable. For all simple consumer IVAs, the protocol
                            establishes a uniform format.
                            <br />
                            The protocol establishes an uniform procedure for:<br />
                            the proposal's substance, how income and spending are calculated, how equity in the home is
                            handled, and the IVA's terms and conditions
                            If you have a regular income and at least three debts with two or more creditors, you will
                            be eligible for an IVA under the protocol.

          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:30px">We or our third-party partners may place targeting cookies
            (also called advertising cookies) on your browser
            when you are browsing our website to allow us to tailor our marketing to you and your interests.
            Targeting cookies are not used to directly identify you. They record information like your visit to our
            websites, details of other websites that directed you to our websites, your responses to our online
            advertisements and pages you have visited so that we and our partners can gain insights into what
            communications, products, and services you or other potential customers may be interested in.
            In order to gain these insights, sometimes we may analyze your personal data to create a profile of your
            interests and preferences so that we can communicate information relevant to you and your interests. We also
            may make use of additional information about you when it is available from internal and external third-party
            sources.
            We use the information collected by these cookies to:
            tailor our advertisements or offers to you (including those on our or third party websites, such as social
            media networks or otherwise)
            make our websites more relevant to your interests based on your past visits to our websites
            evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising activities
            help us identify customers similar to our audience</p>

          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;"> Creditfix employs cookies for marketing and analytics
            purposes</h5>

          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">Yes, to the extent legally allowed in some areas, we may use
            information acquired through our cookies to
            identify user behaviour and deliver content and offers based on your profile, as well as for the other
            reasons
            indicated below.

            In other situations, we can link cookie data (including data from cookies put through our adverts on
            third-party sites) to an identifiable person. For instance:

            We will know if you open, read, or delete a targeted email if it contains web beacons, cookies, or other
            similar technology. Even if you are not registered or signed into our site, when you click a link in a
            marketing e-mail from creditfix, we will use a cookie to track what pages you see and what material you
            download from our websites.
            Combining and analysing personal data – As previously stated, we may combine data from publicly available
            sources as well as our various e-mail, website, and personal interactions with you (this includes
            information
            collected in our various websites, such as our careers and corporate sites, as well as information
            collected when you sign-up or log on to our sites or connect to our sites using your social media
            credentials)
            (such as LinkedIn). We aggregate this information to evaluate your Creditfix experience.</p>





          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">What types of cookies does the site use?</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">The cookies used on Creditfix sites have been categorized as
            per the table below. However, it is important to
            note that not all cookies may be used in all jurisdictions or websites. A list of the categories of cookies
            used on this website is set out below.</p>
          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">Strictly Necessary cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move
            around the site and use its features, such as
            accessing secure areas of the site. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.
          </p>
          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">First party analytics cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">These cookies allow us to employ data analytics so we can
            measure and improve the performance of our site and
            provide more relevant content to you. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor down
            to an individual level that is available to us. These cookies are not passing personally identifiable
            information to any external third party other than in limited cases when we engage a service provider to act
            on our behalf but who is then unable to use the data for their own purposes. These include, Adobe’s
            Analytics,
            Target and Audience Manager; Contentsquare and Demandbase.</p>
          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">Performance cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">Performance cookies are generally third-party cookies from
            vendors we work with or who work on our behalf that
            collect information about your visit and use of the Creditfix website, for instance which pages you visit
            the
            most often, and if you get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that
            identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how the
            website works. Third party vendors may have access to this data and may use it to improve their overall
            services and offerings.</p>
          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">Functionality cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">These cookies allow a site to remember choices you make (such
            as your username, language or the region you are
            in) and provide more enhanced, personal features.
            These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. They don’t gather any information about
            you that could be used for advertising or remembering where you’ve been on the Internet outside our site.
          </p>
          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">Advertising and social media cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">Advertising and social media cookies (including web beacons and
            other tracking and storage technologies) are
            used to (1) deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests; (2) limit the number of times
            you
            see an advertisement; (3) help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign; (4) retargeting to
            Creditfix websites/information and (5) understand people’s behavior after they view an advertisement. They
            are
            usually placed on behalf of advertising networks with the site operator’s permission. They remember that you
            have visited a site and quite often they will be linked to site functionality provided by the other
            organization. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.</p>

          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;"> Cookies for functionality:</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">Improving your online experience These cookies keep track of
            your choices and adapt
            the website to meet your needs. We can't remember your preferences or customize your online experience
            without
            these cookies.</p>
          <br />
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">This sort of cookie is used to:
            Remember you between visits on your devices to make online banking login faster.
            Make online transactions easier by remembering your most recent account and using it as the default for your
            next transaction.
            Remember which panels you've extended and collapsed when displaying your mini-statement. Remember essential
            information as you navigate from page to page to avoid having to retype the same information. Session
            cookies
            and persistent cookies are the two types of cookies. Session cookies are only stored on your computer for
            the
            duration of your visit to a website. When you close your browser, they disappear. Security can be aided by
            session cookies. They can, for example, keep you signed in as you navigate a website. When you close your
            browser, persistent cookies remain on your device. They're utilised for a variety of tasks. They can
            remember
            your User ID for websites where you log in, for example. They can also remember your preferences for when
            you
            return to a website. They help businesses understand how consumers use their websites. They may also be used
            to personalise advertisements and marketing on social media, apps, and other websites. Cookies from the
            first
            and third parties The origin of a cookie determines whether it is a first or third party. Websites you visit
            set first-party cookies. Outside organisations set third-party cookies. If you click one, the social media
            site will place a 'third party' cookie on your computer. That cookie may then collect and communicate data
            about you to them as well. To inform them how they can use your data, you must establish your privacy
            preferences on their site.
            Emails with cookies We employ cookies and similar technology in emails in addition to the cookies we use on
            our website. These let us determine whether or not you have opened an email and how you have engaged with
            it.
            If you click on a link inside the email, cookies may be set.</p>
          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">How to Manage and Remove Cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">You may change your browser to limit or reject cookies, or you
            can close the email before downloading any
            pictures or clicking on any links if you don't want to accept cookies in emails.

            Are you okay with us using cookies?
            Some features meant to improve your online experience are only available if cookies are used.
            You may change your mind at any moment, but are you okay with us storing and accessing cookies on your

          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">The Lloyds Banking Group is updating its websites to ensure
            that we obtain your permission to use certain
            cookies. All of our systems will require some time to be updated. You won't be able to make decisions on
            some
            websites managed by companies in our group until then. This means that even if you don't want to, you may
            still see targeted marketing and adverts from us during this period. As soon as the work is finished, we
            will
            update this cookie policy.</p>







          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">Various kinds of cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">Session cookies: These are transient cookies that disappear
            when your browser is closed.

            Persistent cookies: These cookies remain on your computer until you actively delete your browsing history or
            for a predetermined amount of time.

            Cookies from the first and third parties: The term "first" or "third" party refers to the website or domain
            that set the cookie. The website displayed in the URL window, which you have already visited, is the one
            that
            sets first-party cookies. Other domains set third-party cookies. For instance, Facebook will establish a
            cookie when you view or share our content there.
            Cookies that are necessary for the services we provide are classified as "Necessary" cookies. These cannot
            be
            opted out of. We require your consent to set any other cookies, including those used by third-party
            services.
            Use the instructions in the guides below to learn how to update your settings at any time.</p>

          <h5 class="entry-heading" style="margin-top:20px;">Google Analytics cookies</h5>
          <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">On our website, Google Analytics has been installed. It's a web
            analytics service that Google, Inc. offers
            (Google). Cookies are used by Google Analytics to track website usage.
            Google will receive and store the data produced by the cookie about how you use the website (including your
            IP
            address) on servers located in the United States. This data will be used by Google to analyse how you use
            the
            site, create reports, and do other tasks related to website activity and internet usage.
            When required to do so by law or when such third parties process the information on Google's behalf, Google
            may also disclose this information to third parties. Your IP address won't be linked to any other
            information
            that Google stores.

            By choosing the proper options in your browser (see below), you can decline the use of cookies, but keep in
