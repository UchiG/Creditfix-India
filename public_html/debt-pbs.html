                            engagement, and optimise SEO.
                            More than 5 billion Google searches take place every day, so search engine optimization
                            (SEO), which involves modifying your website to increase the quantity of high-quality
                            traffic that it receives, is crucial for engaging your audience.

                            According to Chris Homer, an SEO Analyst at Mailchimp, "SEO is free publicity for your

                            Designing and updating your site for SEO is simple when you know what improves your rating
                            in a search result and what makes it fall. Utilize the checklist to incorporate SEO into
                            your digital marketing strategy after learning more about SEO in the section below. SEO
                            checklist: How to improve your results
                            The good news about SEO planning is that what works for SEO also aligns with providing a
                            positive user experience (UX) for people who visit your website. So, SEO-friendly changes
                            equal a better site for the people you want to engage.
                            “SEO should be a consideration throughout every step of your website build and your
                            marketing journey,” says Ade Lewis, Partnerships Director at Mailchimp. “It’s the number one
                            way a consumer will find a small business.”
                            Review this checklist to learn about the changes and adjustments you can make to improve
                            your SEO.
                            Feature relevant keywords. Keywords are words or phrases that people type into search
                            engines to find something. All areas of your website—including page names, headlines, site
                            copy, image captions, page descriptions, and URLs—need to include keywords in a natural way
                            that doesn’t sound too forced.
                            Since people search with specific needs in mind, your keywords should be “long tail,”
                            meaning descriptive and narrowly focused. For example, “wedding photography Newport RI” will
                            work better than just “professional photography.” Specific keywords will bring in less
                            traffic overall, but ranking for more detailed searches will result in a higher conversion
                            rate.
                            Have a clean site structure. Make sure your website is organized in a way that makes it easy
                            for users and search engines to travel through your site and find what they’re looking for.
                            Internal links from one page to another within your site should provide content that
                            educates your visitor, answers a question about what you offer, or engages them in some
                            other valuable way. Internal links give Google more clues about what your website is about,
                            so it can send relevant visitors your way.
                            Feature substantial content. Create website content that’s relevant to your top keywords and
                            hefty enough to be valuable. While punchy, skimmable content is great, keep in mind that
                            Google wants content that solves the search intent, so pages with fewer than 200 words will
                            not be highly ranked. If you want to add meat to your copy, be sure each page solves a
                            problem, answers a question, or moves a visitor forward in their journey through your site.
                            Use relevant title tags. A title tag or page tag is the “headline” for a page when it
                            appears in search engine results pages (SERP). The words or phrases in your title tags
                            should be specific and descriptive. Think, “Learn How to Paint Landscapes and Portraits"
                            instead of "Painting Class." Combining this with the meta description—a longer blurb in
                            search results that says more about what your content provides—encourages users to click
                            through to your website. Title tags also appear in your visitors’ web browser tabs and in
                            social media when your content is shared. This is easy to do in Mailchimp’s website builder.
                            Simply go to the page settings and edit the SEO title to create a title tag and the SEO
                            description to write a meta description.
                            Add alt tags. An alt tag is a text description of an image. It serves 3 important purposes.
                            Search engines can’t interpret images, so alt tags help them identify and rank these pieces
                            of content, improving your SEO. They also help website visitors when an image doesn’t
                            display properly on their screen or load quickly by providing a clue about what image they
                            should be seeing. Last, and definitely not least, alt tags are easy for screen readers to
                            decipher, so they help with web accessibility. Alt tags should be short and
                            descriptive—think, “paddle board on lake with smiling boy” or “chocolate cake with vanilla
                            frosting and strawberry.”
                            Optimize for mobile. Google prioritizes mobile websites, so making sure your website is
                            mobile friendly is critical. This means providing a visually pleasing and easy-to-use
                            experience no matter what device someone is visiting from. Mobile sites also must load
                            quickly on a 3G connection, render properly on any sized screen, have well-spaced site
                            elements that users can easily tap on to take action, and feature content that’s entirely
                            visible without having to scroll left or right. Mailchimp websites are built with mobile in
                            mind—the website builder allows you to preview your website on a mobile phone to see how it
                            looks.
                            Enable fast load times. Ideally your pages should load in under 2 seconds—less than 3 is a
                            must. If they do, it’ll improve your search rankings. There are several things that can slow
                            down your load time, including issues with your content management system (CMS), poorly
                            written code, low bandwidth that can’t handle your traffic volume, or numerous large images
                            on a page. Use Google PageSpeed Insights to test how quickly your website is loading. Be
                            sure you host your website on a platform that enables fast load times.
                            Install Google Search Console and Analytics. Google Search Console will help you see if
                            Google is finding and indexing all of the pages on your website to highlight places you can
                            improve performance. It can also help you set up your own site search tracking. You can
                            connect to Google Analytics from your Mailchimp dashboard to monitor your traffic, see what
                            pages are being visited the most, and what links direct visitors to your website. Here's a
                            guide to help you set up Google Analytics.
                            Make sure your website and URL are secure. Google considers HTTPS encryption a top priority,
                            and will show a security warning in search results if a website is not HTTPs encrypted. Work
                            with a website builder that makes security a priority. All websites created with Mailchimp
                            include an SSL certificate—this encrypts data and guarantees the authenticity of a website
                            to visitors.

                            You're prepared to start your online business. With Mailchimp's commerce capabilities, you

                            total control over the success of your company.
                            Anyone who hits your homepage needs to be immediately engaged if you want them to stay. When
                            you consider that 47% of visitors "bounce off" or quit a website after reading just one
                            page, the significance of this initial connection becomes even more obvious.

                            Being a good host at a party is similar to creating an effective webpage. Your site should
                            greet visitors, offer a space that's simple to explore, and assist them in finding what they
                            need.

                            According to Jen Ellis, Senior Product Design Manager at Mailchimp, "a homepage is a chance
                            to clearly out what you do and grab a visitor's attention." We are aware that visitors
                            decide quickly whether they want to learn more.
                            Communicate your top messages
                            The most important thing your homepage should do is clearly convey what you offer, and to
                            whom. If you can do this, you stand a good chance of engaging your visitor. Assess your
                            homepage by asking the following 2 questions.
                            1. Can anyone quickly “get” what you do? The layout, copy, and graphics on your homepage
                            should all work toward the goal of spelling out what your business offers. You’ll know
                            you’ve done it when a first-time visitor, in just a few moments, can understand what you do
                            or sell.
                            What’s typically required to achieve this clear homepage messaging is iteration. This just
                            means creating a homepage, showing it to people—including friends and potential target
                            audience members—and adjusting until it’s clear. Encourage people to be honest with you,
                            make adjustments, and show it to them again until you get it right.
                            2. Does your audience know they’re in the right place? Part of what makes a homepage
                            compelling to your audience is presenting information that’s valuable to them. Evoke this
                            feeling by using keywords they use to describe themselves in the context of your offering.
                            This is an easy but essential part of search engine optimization (SEO), and it not only
                            makes your website more discoverable on search, it makes your site more engaging. For
                            example, if you provide a service for people looking to meet someone, you might use terms
                            like “discerning" or “good match" if those are the aspirational words people use during this
                            process.
                            If you serve more than one audience, that’s ok. Just be sure to communicate to each one
                            separately. For example, if you broker paintings for artists, you may want to welcome both
                            gallery owners and individual buyers with separate sections that quickly communicate that
                            you’re an important contact for both.

                            your creditors to pay back your debts over a period of time. An insolvency practitioner must
                            set it up. When establishing and administering an IVA, all insolvency practitioners must
                            adhere to a set of guidelines.

                            <br />Most insolvency practitioners and creditors have signed up to a voluntary code of
                            practice known as the IVA Protocol.
                            <br />
                            The protocol's goal is to ensure that the processes involved in an individual voluntary
                            arrangement (IVA) are transparent and equitable. For all simple consumer IVAs, the protocol
                            establishes a uniform format.
                            <br />
                            The protocol establishes an uniform procedure for:<br />
                            the proposal's substance, how income and spending are calculated, how equity in the home is
                            handled, and the IVA's terms and conditions
                            If you have a regular income and at least three debts with two or more creditors, you will
                            be eligible for an IVA under the protocol.

                    make sure that each
                    customer has their own case handler. They will pay attention to you and learn about your
                    circumstances and business. This enables us to pursue debts with as much information as possible,
                    increasing the likelihood of your debt being recovered in full and sooner.
                    <br />
                    Through search and credit-checking tools, we can hunt down and analyse both an individual's and a
                    business's capacity to repay. With the help of our in-house legal experts, we can quickly work out
                    repayment arrangements and resolve disputes.

                        The ideal candidate for a debt management plan is someone with high-interest debt (i.e. credit
                        cards) – and a steady enough income to handle that debt.

                        on your secured debt such as your mortgage and car payments, you’d be joining a very long line

                  <h5 class="entry-heading">Other Debt Relief Options</h5>
                  <p class="entry-desc" style="margin-left:20px">If debt management plans might not be the right
                    solution for your credit card
                    problem, there are other debt-relief options.
                    The alternative solutions could be:
                    Debt Consolidation Loan
                    If you qualify – i.e. you have a very good credit score, 670 or higher – you would receive a loan
                    that could pay off your credit card debt at a lower interest rate and monthly payment.
                    Debt Settlement
                    Debt settlement is when a creditor agrees to accept payment that is less than what is owed on your
                    credit card debt. Sounds too good to be true? Well, there’s reason for that.
                    This is a risky alternative. You may end up paying less than you owe, but your credit score will
                    plummet. You’ll find it difficult to get a future loan since you failed to make the full payment on
                    this one. And keep in mind you could still pay taxes if the amount forgiven is more than $600. So,
                    consider debt settlement only if other avenues are closed.
                    Credit Card Debt Forgiveness
                    This is the same principle as debt settlement – pay less than what you owe – but with some major
                    differences.
                    Credit card debt forgiveness is only offered by a few nonprofit credit counseling agencies
                    (including InCharge Debt Solutions) and they only have agreements with a select group of card
                    companies. These companies already have agreed to allow qualified consumers to pay 50%-60% of what
                    they owe over a 36-month period and waive the remaining balance.

                    When the size of your debt overwhelms your income, it may be time to consider a fresh start through
                    bankruptcy .A successful bankruptcy filing will eliminate all credit card debt, but also leaves a
                    7-10 year negative mark on your credit report.
